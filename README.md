# DinoDroid

DinoDroid is a tool that can automatically reproduce android bugs.

[Source Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gCszF_CN7SUcq6_fWkU6t5Oz3TRRRNTk/view?usp=sharing) is ready.

I will build a new virtual machine to test the source code in an independent environment before Feb 5, 2021.

The new virtual machine will be also available in public at that time.
