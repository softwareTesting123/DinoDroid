#################run
How to run:

Train:
clean up all of models in /model
run
python RunTrain.py


Test:

run
python RunTest.py

################ result
You may need to clean up files in /Result before you run train or test. 

The coverage result will be in /Result:
XXX_coverage_0.txt
XXX_coverage_1.txt
XXX_coverage_2.txt

XXX is the app source code folder name



The crash result will be in /Result:
XXX_crash_0.txt
XXX_crash_1.txt
...

XXX is the app source code folder name


Every sample in the training and testing will be recorded in \Result:
_trainRecord_              means the current sample 
_trainRecordOther_         means the sample in memory
Users may use them to understand how our model works.
